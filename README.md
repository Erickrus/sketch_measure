# sketch_measure
This library is built to parse the exported index.html file, generated by [Sketch Measure](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure) plugin. It helps the programmer to quickly get the information from its embedded json data. So, the automation from the index.html file is made possible with this library for further processing.

# Usage
Assume exported index.html is here:
```shell
└── sketch_measure_demo
    ├── assets
    ├── index.html
    ├── links
    ├── preview
    └── sketch_measure_demo.sketch
```
Following codes demostrate how to get the information.

```python3
from sketch_measure import SketchMeasure

sm = SketchMeasure.load("sketch_measure_demo/index.html")
# then all elements are available as python object

for layer in sm.artboards[0].layers:
    layer.pretty_print()
```
